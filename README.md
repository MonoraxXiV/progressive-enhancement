This repository is an exercise to progressively enhance a website.
It's made as an exercise for Becode by junior web developer in training MonoraxXiV as an exercise.
This exercise was made very early into the course.
The point of the exercise was to teach us about basic CSS commands but also about the purpose and importance of semantics.

We used the google lighthouse test to see how well our website scored and used it as a tool to see where can make improvements on our site.
