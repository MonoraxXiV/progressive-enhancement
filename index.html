<h4>The story</h4>
<article>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to
        commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q> The farmer
        said,<q class="farmer"> <strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
        with
        it, and in the
        evening everybody
        came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
            horses!</q> The farmer
        again
        said,<q class="farmer"> <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The
        neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that's too
            <tag attribute="Bad">bad</tag>
            , </q> and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer">
            <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q> The
        next day the
        conscription
        officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again
        all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn't that great!</q> Again, he said,<q
                class="farmer">
            <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is
        <tag attribute="Good">good</tag>
        or
        <tag attribute="Bad">bad</tag>
        - because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
        <tag attribute="Good">good</tag>
        fortune.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    <tag attribute="Good">good</tag>
    and
    <tag attribute="Bad">bad</tag>
    are just one <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/perspective"
                    title="Perspective." target="_blank">perspective</a>. Bananas are good for monkeys,
    but monkeys are
    <tag attribute="Bad">not good</tag>
    for bananas. Let's
    not make a big deal out of it...
