<h4>The story</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
        unfortunate.</q> The farmer
    said,<q class="farmer"> <strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
    it, and in the
    evening everybody
    came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
        horses!</q> The farmer
    again
    said,<q class="farmer"> <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
    neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that's too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer">
        <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q> The
    next day the
    conscription
    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again
    all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn't that great!</q> Again, he said,<q class="farmer">
        <strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is
    <tag attribute="Good">good</tag>
    or bad - because you never know what will be the consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
    <tag attribute="Good">good</tag>
    fortune.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p> Good and Bad are just one <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/perspective"

    but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
    not make a big deal out of it...
